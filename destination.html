      <ul class="visitor-tips">
        <li>Spots on the beaches will be grabbed quick, the earlier you can claim a spot the better.</li>
        <li>Due to Destin being so popular everything from the locations to stay at to the places to eat are pricey</li>
        <li>Be careful in the water, unlike some beaches on the east coast Florida weather can be severe and the waves
          show that.</li>
        <li>You do not need to spend money to have fun, the attractions are nice however the beaches are the reason
          Destin is so popular in the first place/</li>
